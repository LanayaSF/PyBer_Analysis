# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### We analyzed data from the ride sharing app PyBer, comparing fares across urban, suburban, and rural geos, from 01/2019 to 04/2019. 

## Results

### Looking at our chart, week over week, we found that urban fares were consistently the highest during the time frame. Suburban fares were the second highest, and the lowest total fares were found in rural geos. 

Referencing the table, we can see that urban geos had the greatest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares, yet the lowest average fare per ride, and the lowest average fare per driver, compared to suburban and rural geos. The rural geo had the lowest number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares, yet the highest average fare per ride, and highest average fare per driver. 

## Summary

### Based on this data, we can conclude that urban geos contribute the greatest to volume rides and revenue, but rural rides are the most profitable. This makes sense as rides in urban geos are likely shorter distance, but more frequent, given the close proximity of destinations in the urban design, and the greater urban population. Rides in rural geos would logically be longer and fewer. Distances to destinations are likely greater, the population in rural regions is less dense, and many residents likely own cars and thus there is not as great of a demand in ride sharing. Our recommendation is to continue maintaining strong presence in urban geos because the number of rides indicates a strong demand in the region, and there is significant contribution to revenue. We recommend scaling back on the marketing to rural regions as the number of drivers exceeded the number of rides in the region, thus the driver market is saturated. Suburban regions should continue to operate as is, since this region is pulling a healthy number of rides and fares.
